* Leuven-theme

Looking for an awesome Emacs color theme?  Here's the place to find one!

Welcome to the custom Leuven theme, an elegant color theme for light
backgrounds, with built-in style for many components such as Org mode, Gnus,
Dired+ and EDiff. Make it yours!

Though Leuven-theme has been added *in 24.4*, you can get a fresh version of it,
at any time, from [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]] or from [[https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme/][GitHub]].

** Install the ELPA package

In Emacs 24.x, =M-x list-packages= is the /recommended way/ to list and install
packages.

MELPA keeps stable releases of Leuven theme.

See http://melpa.milkbox.net/#installing for more information on how to install
=leuven-theme=:

1. Just add MELPA to =package-archives=,

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ;; archives from which to fetch
   (setq package-archives
         (append '(("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
                 package-archives))
   #+end_src

2. Call =list-packages=,
3. Search for =leuven-theme=,
4. Mark it for installation with =i=, and
5. Execute the install action with =x=.

** Install the Git version

Get the full Git repository at https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme
using the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme.git
#+END_SRC

Add the following in your =.emacs= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/emacs-leuven-theme")
(load-theme 'leuven t)                  ;; for Emacs 24+
#+END_SRC

Restart Emacs.
